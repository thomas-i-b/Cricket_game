# Cricket_game
I have used JavaScript, html and Css to build this project. It is a simple application that functions similar to rock-paper-scissor-game. The computer inputs are random and user inputs are considered. The Score is recorded in the local storage unless you reset it.  Combinations of choises Bat+Stump=Stump wins, Bat+Ball=Bat wins, Ball+Stump=Ball win
